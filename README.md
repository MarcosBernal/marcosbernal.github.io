# Use of libraries

I found these libraries very powerful and, as result, I decided to use them.

- [jquery](https://jquery.com/): No intro needed
- [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome): just awesome, like their icons
- [w3.css](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/): whereas the w3.css is not a library but a framework it is going to be here added here. BTW, useful
- [Visjs](http://visjs.org/): To create the graph and it interaction within the canvas
- [Twitter Post Fetch](https://github.com/jasonmayes/Twitter-Post-Fetcher): Get tweets is an easy task, doing that without oauth is another matter
- [Dislines](http://www.danielclemente.com/dislines/): Transform multilingual tagged files into several files one per language tagged. Easier translation and maintenance.
