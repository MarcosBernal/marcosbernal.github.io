    We live in a really good period, at least, for tech lovers. We have access to many services and resources
    that not so long ago were not even thought about.
    <br><br>
    Since I was a child, I have been curious about servers although they seem to be very complex for ordinary people.
    However, I have decided to set my own server with many features, such as multimedia and remote services.
    <br><br>
    Whereas many of the services of my future server are already implemented like owncloud, I would like to prepare a
    remote environment for tensorflow with cuda.

    In construction & development...
