<h2 class="w3-centered"> Time to learn about telco APIs!</h2>
<p>
    It seems to be that every year in Madrid, there is a hackathon called <a href="https://tadhack.com/2017/global/tadhack-madrid/">TADHack</a>.
    The name TADHack comes from Telecom Application Development Hackathon. And, as you have guessed, it is focused on telecommunications with the use
    of the APIs of the sponsors.
    <br><br>
    The event was sponsored by different telecoms such as APIFONICA, Temasys or TelesTax and hosted in the Telecommunication School of UPM, ETSIT.
    It lasted less than 2 days, actually, it was about 28 hours of potential work since the event started at 10:00 am and finished at 2:00 pm of the following day.

    The idea we worked on was assisting people by sending the last stored location to their trustee contacts when a emergency or disaster happen.
    We made use of a LAMP server, developed some php code and run the code in a virtual box of the server of Santiago.

    Even though we got a functional demo, we would like to produce the next version of it. So in some months we will reach the next stage and
    I will update this entry, adding more information.
