<p>Before ending the sixth semester of my bachelor, I had already decided to build some robotic device.</p>

<p>The topic was not completely new for me, I have had some experience in the robotics field giving support
    and developing software for a team located in ETSI Industriales (Spain). However, the 'small' world of microcontrollers
    will become bigger and bigger as one starts to dive in the low level programming and loses the different abstraction
    levels provided by modern languages and operating systems.</p>

<p>Codification disparity, miscalculated high priority interruption or variable overflow could be some of the problems that will arise frequently or, even worse,
    only in unexpected situations. Although the situation of facing unknown and 'weird' situations is pretty common in the day to day of a programmer, facing new complications are time consuming.</p>

<p>The project was a mix of several fields since I have to design, build a model in addition to developing the software in charge of the behavior and control of the device.
    The project also included a virtual representation of the structure made with AutoCAD.</p>

<p>The project was built using a development board, specifically the model EasyPIC6, and the microcontroller PIC18F4520 as well as other components such as the drivers L293 or the converter RS-232 as well as several sensors and actuators.
    But the development board could be removed in the final design, using another breadboard and multiple wires.</p>

<p>My non-existing skill working with wood are notorious in the last picture, although it worked until the end and proved the jury its different features.</p>

<p>To manage this small device, I also developed a basic(but functional) C++ GUI that checked the parameters required to connect the device, sent orders to the device and got feedback from the execution and sensors.</p>

<p>In order to accomplish this project, I got assistance from my supervisor, Antonio Tabernero, and <a href="http://picfernalia.blogspot.com.es/">one of his blogs</a>,
if someone is interested in microcontrollers (and know Spanish) I completely recommend that blogspot as a starting point to dive in the embedded systems field.</p>

<p>The documentation (in Spanish) about that project, which was my undergraduate thesis, is stored in the <a href="http://oa.upm.es/43463/">official library of the UPM</a>. The code is available in <a href="https://bitbucket.org/MarcosBernal/">bitbucket</a>.</p>
