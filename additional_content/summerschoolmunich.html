  Decentralizing the production in Munich!
</h2>
<p>
    In the summer of 2017, I was attending the summer school in TUM (Technische Universit채t M체nchen).
    The topic was about decentralizing production which in my case was related to 3D Printing or, as the expert refer to it,
    <a href="https://www.eos.info/additive_manufacturing">
      additive manufacturing
    </a>.

    It was two intensive weeks where I learned many things and I met a lot of interesting people.
    We were 35 students, and we were split into groups of 4 and one group of 3. The summer school was oriented to use

    </a>
     mentored by
     <a href="">Futurice</a>,
    and honestly, they inspired really well the methodology of lean service creation,
    which at first glance might seem to be just fulfilling canvases without a purpose.

    Our case, presented by EOS, was about understanding the environment of addictive manufacturing and propose
    a solution with a business plan and pitch the presentation in front the EOS, other companies and the rest of
    the group. During the two weeks was time for everything besides hard working. I visited the city center and
    <a href="http://www.deutsches-museum.de/en/collections/">Deutsches Museum</a>
    , which contains material of
    many fields but if you look for something specific as I was, one could not get satisfied.

    Perhaps the most exciting activity was to build a raft and, afterwards, make a rafting race in the Spitzingsee lake.

<p>
    Our day to day was to going forward with a concept or more specifically to create a solution. We create an account for
    <a href="https://twitter.com/EOS_nimbus/status/894848203039944704">
      occasional feed
    </a>.
    <br /><br />
    We performed several interviews with different players, such as W채rtsil채, Mercuris, Shapeways, and 3DBear as well as
    educational institutions like AAlto University or some executives and workers of EOS. Almost at the end of the week,
    we have defined our context, problem and started We prepare a storytelling video that, with the impressive skills
    of my teammates, turned to be very nice.

    The last two days we were working on the pitch, most of the work was done, but then the work had to be
    presented properly. As one of the most intelligent minds said, we prepare the

    as simple as possible but not simpler. And in the midday of 11th August, we pitched.

    We were congratulated by EOS for the hard work done and were told that they annotated many ideas and suggestions.
    Who knows, maybe we will see in the future a solution of EOS very close to our proposal.

    All in all, I met people not only from Europe but also from all parts of the world. Their personality and philosophy of
    life gave me new insights that made me consider many things.
