 Decentralizing the production in Munich!
</h2>
<p>
   In the summer of 2017, I was attending the summer school in TUM (Technische Universit채t M체nchen).
   The topic was about decentralizing production which in my case was related to 3D Printing or, as the expert refer to it,

<a href="https://www.eos.info/additive_manufacturing">additive manufacturing</a>.

   It was two intensive weeks where I learned many things and I met a lot of interesting people.
   We were 35 students, and we were split into groups of 4 to deal with different use cases. The summer school was oriented to use
    <a href="https://leanservicecreation.com/">lean service creation</a>
    mentored by
     <a href="">Futurice</a>,
   and honestly, they inspired really well the methodology of lean service creation,
   which at first glance might seem to be just fulfilling canvases without a purpose.

   Our case, presented by EOS, was about understanding the environment of addictive manufacturing and propose
   a solution with a business plan and pitch the presentation in front the EOS, other companies and the rest of
   the group. During the two weeks was time for everything besides hard working. I visited the city center and the
    <a href="http://www.deutsches-museum.de/en/collections/">Deutsches Museum</a>,
   which contains material of all or almost all science fields but if you look for something specific and deep you could not get satisfied.
    <br /><br />
   Perhaps the most exciting social activity was to build a raft and, afterwards, make a rafting race in the Spitzingsee lake.

<p>
   Our day to day was to going forward with a concept or more specifically to create a solution. We create an account for

    <br /><br />
   We performed several interviews with different players, such as W채rtsil채, Mercuris, Shapeways, and 3DBear as well as
   educational institutions like AAlto University or some executives of EOS. Almost at the end of the week,
   we have defined our context, problem and solution. We prepared a storytelling video that, with the impressive skills
   of my teammates, turned to be very nice.

   The last two days we were working on the pitch because, event though most of the work was done the work, it had to be
   presented properly. As one of the most intelligent minds said once, we prepare the

<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P8Ckiu7l64dJQIIBrj7u9c7JwYHPEnrugejz4RCK2Vo/edit?usp=sharing">slides</a>

   as simple as possible but not simpler. And in the midday of 11th August, we pitched.

<p>
   We were congratulated by EOS for the hard work done and were told that they annotated many ideas and suggestions.
   Who knows, maybe we will see in the future a solution of EOS very close to our proposal.

<p>
   All in all, I met people not only from Europe but also from all parts of the world. Their personality and philosophy of
   life gave me new insights that made me grow up in several ways.
