<h2 class="w3-centered"> How to show your impressive portfolio?</h2>
<p>
    Of course with <a href="https://github.com/MarcosBernal/infobox_matrix">infobox_matrix</a>!!
    <br /><br />
    Well maybe not, however, this project was created because I needed some of its features, and in
    the meantime, I refreshed my old JQuery/CSS knowledge. It is inspired by the
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_modal.asp">
      w3-modal of the w3.css framework
    </a>
    with some customization. Although at the very beginning I did not know about this particular feature.

    I have built this website not from scratch because I have used some libraries and frameworks but I have put some effort to develop it.
    Part of the development has been the <a href="https://github.com/MarcosBernal/infobox_matrix">infobox_matrix repo</a>,
    which I also use for
    <a href="http://www.marcosbernal.es">
      my portfolio
    </a>
    , as you can see above.
    <br /><br />
    Even though the repository is now in an early stage of development with just a few features, it is completely functional...
    and I will continue with the development little by little.
