<h2 class="w3-centered"> How to show your impressive portfolio?</h2>
<p>
    Of course with <a href="https://github.com/MarcosBernal/infobox_matrix">infobox_matrix</a>!!
    <br><br>
    Well maybe not, however this project was created because I needed some of its features, and in
    the meantime I refreshed my old jquery/css knowledge. It is inspired by the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_modal.asp">w3-modal of w3.css framework</a>
    with some customization. Although at the very beginning I did not know about this particular feature.

    I have built this website not from scratch because I have used some libraries and frameworks but I have put some effort to develop it.
    Part of the development has been the <a href="https://github.com/MarcosBernal/infobox_matrix">infobox_matrix repo</a>,
    which I also use for <a href="http://www.marcosbernal.es">my portfolio</a>, as you can see above.
    <br><br>
    Even though the repository is now in a early stage of development with just a few features, it is completely functional. and I will continue with the development little by little.
